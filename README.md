## Automatically rating privacy policies and terms of service using machine learning.

I'm applying a naive Bayesian classifier to a set of clauses from privacy policies and terms-of-service that have been rated by the crowd as 'good', 'bad' or 'neutral'. There are various different topics and the classifier works on a per-topic basis. The classify.py script uses clauses on copyright as an example, but the same principles apply to other clauses.

The data is taken from (tosdr.org)[www.tosdr.org], specifically what's contained in /points. This can be extracted using the getpointsdata.py script.

## Why?

If this approach works, it could give an automatic score to any privacy policy / terms-of-service text. No one has time to read these texts, so an automated guess as to how good or bad they are, even if it is imperfect, could be quite useful.
